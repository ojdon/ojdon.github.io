It's a three day weekend due to the Summer bank holiday here in the United Kingdom, so I spent the remaining day adding in the remaining pages for this website and I've finally completed the site!

Now, it's not 100% complete as I still need to dig through last year's university assignment and start open sourcing the codebase so I can link to live demo for each portfolio piece. However, I feel the site is ready for me to start blogging again.

I am going to try and get a couple of initial blog posts together regarding several aspects of my interests including the development process of this very website and talk about all things open source!

Apologies for the quick blog post but I'm currently planning out a couple of future blog posts and might as well start writing them straight away!
