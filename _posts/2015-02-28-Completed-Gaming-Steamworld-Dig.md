I'll be honest with you. I was so ashamed of my game collection, that I couldn't even look at it all! Not because my tastes in video games were bad, but because I had hardly completed any of them. I'm sure there is a lot of you reading this now that have a vast collection of games yet you have probably only completed a small minority. Heck, I bet there are only a handful games in your collection that you've played through a second time once completing. Don't worry, you've probably been busy studying or working, or like myself, both!

That's why, I have set myself the challenge this year of completing at least one game a month. Whether it's a game I've bought this year and what to play it from start to finish, or a game I've had sitting in my collection, yet to be played. I even have games that I just left unfinished itching to find the time to set aside and finally complete my progress.

Starting off the year, I played Steamworld Dig for the Playstation Vita. I got it via Playstation Plus and it's been sitting on my Vita for a while, completely unplayed. I had a rough idea what to expect, but I didn't think I'd sit down and play it religiously every night during January of this year, like I did until I finally got to the end credits.

The story was fairly simple and you could of easily be skipped over without affecting gameplay. You start off as a robot called 'Rusty' who arrives in a small 'steampunk-western' themed town called 'Tumbleton' as you had received a deed to an old mine from a distant Uncle. From there you descend into a vast mine, picking your way through rocks and ore, underground. However, you can only carry so much and you have a limited supply of 'light' before you need to resurface in order to recharge again. The ore that you have collected can be exchanged for money which, in turn, can be used to purchase upgrades such as better pickaxes. Other useful items such as ladders and dynamite can also be purchased to aid you in your quest to go deeper underground.

As you progress through the mine, not only do you gain special abilities such as using stored water in order to do a really high jump but also 'Tumbleton' expands, giving you more places to buy additional items. All these abilities and upgrades enable you to prepare for the final boss who, without spoiling the ending, can be tricky to defeat. But, with a lot of trial-and-error you will find patterns in the boss' attacks in order for you to find ways of lowering the boss' health down to zero.

Once the boss has been defeated. You're done! If I remember correctly, it took me around 4 hours of gameplay to complete. I definitely would sit down and play it again and maybe not rush to the boss as quickly as I did. Anyone who has got Steamworld Dig sitting unplayed in their library I definitely recommend the game, especially if you enjoy small 'pick up and play' independent titles.

As Steamworld Dig was a game that I completed from start to finish in just one month, I decided that my next game that I would complete would be one that I have had sitting unfinished in my collection for a while. Therefore, I picked Season 2 of Telltale's 'The Walking Dead video game' as I had got through a few of the episodes before I had to wait for the rest to be released, which, unfortunately, I never resumed.
