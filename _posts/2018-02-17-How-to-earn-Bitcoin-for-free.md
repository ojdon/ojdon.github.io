Bitcoin is one of the biggest players in the exciting new world of cryptocurrency. But are you still unsure in investing in some? Well, I have a nice solution to obtaining Bitcoin without investing. 

I have been using the website [Freebitco.in](https://freebitco.in/?r=2741724) for a little over a year now. All you need to do is sign up for an account and tick a Google reCAPTCHA box every hour. Of course, it's not a free whole Bitcoin (At the time of writing 1 BTC = over 9900 USD).

What is the catch? Well, the reason why they're giving you small amounts of Bitcoin every hour is due to the fact they also run a little HI-LO gambling game. I don't agree with gambling games, so I am content with earning the small amounts of Bitcoin every hour.
