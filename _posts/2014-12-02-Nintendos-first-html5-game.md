  <p>Mario vs Donkey Kong seen at 4:31</p>

As a Wii U owner myself, I was excited to see this video shown on the Nintendo Wii U eShop which features upcoming titles for the Wii U console over the next year or so. One of the games that stood out to me was the trailer for the "Mario vs Donkey Kong" game which was originally shown to the public at this year's Game Developers Conference.

The game was originally shown off as a prototype of how the Nintendo Web Frameworks can be used in order to make Web-based games for the Nintendo console, but it now seems to be a full fledged game! Therefore, making this Nintendo's first HTML5 based game!

Clear proof that HTML5 games are becoming a choice for AAA game developers and not just for independent game developers such as hobbyists, like myself.
