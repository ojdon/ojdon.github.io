		<p class="lead">Hello world! I'm Oliver Reardon, a 22 year old student, who is currently located in the West Midlands of England. I am currently studying at Staffordshire University for a degree in Web Development. Last year, I was on my placement year at <a href="http://www.rapidweb.biz"/>Rapid Web Ltd</a> where I have worked on several projects to expand my knowledge in Web development, web design, Search Engine Optimization and Ecommerce.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I have a passion for keeping up to date with the bleeding edge web technology and also have a desire to work on game concepts that have an interesting twist. I am also a keen guitarist and have owned several Electric and Acoustic guitars along with a collection of effects pedals and amplifiers.</p>
